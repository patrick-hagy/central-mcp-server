# Capability Reference

This page lists what the Central MCP server can do, grouped by capability category rather than
individual API endpoints. Each category names the MCP tools that power it and the Central API
family they call. For real example questions per area, see
[What You Can Ask](what-you-can-ask.md).

**Current as of v0.2.0.** This reference is updated with every release.

## At a glance

| Category | What you can ask about | Tools | Central API family |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Sites & network health](#sites--network-health) | Fleet-wide health overview, per-site metrics | 1 | Network Monitoring |
| [Devices](#devices) | Inventory, family detail, and trends | 3 | Network Monitoring |
| [WLANs](#wlans) | Configured WLANs, per-WLAN throughput | 1 | Network Monitoring |
| [Clients](#clients) | Connected/failed clients, exact MAC lookup, usage, roaming, onboarding | 2 | Network Monitoring |
| [Alerts](#alerts) | Active alerts per site, by severity/category | 1 | Network Notifications |
| [Events](#events) | Event records and facets for a site, device, or client | 1 | Network Troubleshooting |
| [Gateway clusters](#gateway-clusters) | Cluster health, resources, and capacity | 1 | Network Monitoring |
| [Live troubleshooting](#live-troubleshooting) | Ping/traceroute-style tests, show commands, port bounce | 3 | Network Troubleshooting |
| [Configuration](#configuration) | Read configuration profiles; optional write-back | 2 | Network Configuration |

**14 tools total** (13 by default; `central_write_config` is opt-in). All tools are read-only
except `central_bounce_port` and `central_write_config`, which change device or configuration
state and always ask for your confirmation first.

## Categories

### Sites & network health

Fleet-wide status and per-site drill-down. The usual entry point for any investigation.

- `central_get_sites` — paginated summary or detailed health views; `view` selects the upstream view and `response_format` shapes returned fields.

### Devices

Cross-type device queries when you don't yet know whether something is an AP, switch, or gateway.

- `central_get_devices` — unified inventory and AP/switch/gateway monitoring lists, plus exact serial/name lookup.
- `central_get_device_details` — typed AP, switch, or gateway snapshots with family-specific includes.
- `central_get_device_trends` — bounded family-specific time-series samples.

### WLANs

- `central_get_wlans` — WLAN inventory and optional throughput for an exact WLAN name.

### Clients

- `central_get_clients` — filtered client lists or one exact MAC-address lookup.
- `central_get_client_analytics` — `metric="usage"` for byte usage, top clients, or client-count trends; `metric="mobility"` for one client's roam trail; `metric="onboarding"` for per-stage (assoc, auth, dhcp, dns) attempt outcomes with an overall 0–100 score, top failure/delay reasons, or grouped counts.

### Alerts

- `central_get_alerts` — filtered alerts for a site, by device type, severity, or category.

### Events

- `central_get_events` — `mode="records"` returns events; `mode="facets"` returns count/filter breakdowns.

### Gateway clusters

- `central_get_gateway_cluster` — cluster members and tunnel health with optional resources and capacity trends.

### Live troubleshooting

Live diagnostics executed on Central-managed devices.

- `central_run_network_test` — run a network diagnostic test (e.g. ping) from a device.
- `central_run_show_commands` — run show commands on a device and return the output.
- `central_bounce_port` — bounce ports or toggle PoE. **Changes device state**; always requires your explicit confirmation.

### Configuration

Central configuration profiles from the `network-config/v1alpha1` API.

- `central_get_config` — read any configuration resource (e.g. `layer2-vlan`, `wlan-ssids`, `scope-maps`), a whole collection or one profile by `name`; pass `scope_id` + `persona` for a scope-level (local) profile.
- `central_write_config` — create, update, replace, or delete a profile. **Opt-in** with `ENABLE_CONFIG_WRITES=true`; shows the current config and request body and always requires your explicit confirmation.

## Scope & limitations

- **New Central only.** The server targets the new HPE Aruba Networking Central REST APIs (`network-monitoring/v1`, `network-notifications/v1`, `network-troubleshooting/v1`, `network-config/v1alpha1`). Classic Central APIs are not supported.
- **Configuration writes are opt-in.** By default the server only reads configuration. Writes require `ENABLE_CONFIG_WRITES=true` plus confirmation of every change, and use Central's preview `v1alpha1` configuration API.
- **Live data.** Every answer reflects your Central instance at query time; nothing is cached or stored.

Capability coverage grows with each release — see the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for what each version added.
