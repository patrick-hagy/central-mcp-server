## Overview

`central-mcp-server` wraps Central REST APIs and exposes them as [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tools — **13 MCP tools** (14 with configuration writes enabled) across inventory, monitoring, events, alerts, troubleshooting, and configuration. Once configured, AI assistants like Claude or GitHub Copilot can answer questions like:

- *"Which sites have poor health scores right now?"*
- *"Show me all failed wireless clients at HQ in the last 24 hours."*
- *"Show me all online access points at the Chicago office."*
- *"What events happened on switch SW-CORE-01 yesterday?"*

See the [full overview guide](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/central-mcp-overview) for a deeper look at capabilities, limitations, and how the server works.

---

## Getting Started

### Getting Your Credentials

You need three values to connect this server to Central's REST APIs: `CENTRAL_BASE_URL`, `CENTRAL_CLIENT_ID`, and `CENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET`.

#### API Gateway Base URL (CENTRAL_BASE_URL)

The API gateway base URL for your Central account (e.g. `https://us5.api.central.arubanetworks.com`).

> For instructions on how to locate your base URL, see [Finding Your Base URL in Central](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/getting-started-with-rest-apis#finding-your-base-url).

#### API Client Credentials (CENTRAL_CLIENT_ID & CENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET)

OAuth credentials created through the HPE GreenLake Platform:

1. Log in to your HPE GreenLake account and open **Manage Workspace**.
2. Click **Personal API clients**.
3. Click **Create Personal API client**.
4. Give it a nickname (e.g. `central-mcp-server`) and select your **HPE Aruba Networking Central** instance from the service dropdown.
5. Click **Create personal API client**.
6. Copy both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** immediately. The platform does not store the secret and it cannot be retrieved later.

### Installation

Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if you haven't already — it's the only prerequisite.

**Using an MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot)?**
No install command needed. Jump to [MCP Client Configuration](#mcp-client-configuration) — the client fetches and runs the server automatically via `uvx`.

**Want the server as a persistent CLI tool on your PATH?**

```bash
uv tool install --prerelease=allow central-mcp-server
```

> `--prerelease=allow` is required because this server depends on `pycentral`, which currently only has a pre-release version on PyPI. uv skips pre-releases by default.

See the [full setup guide](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/central-mcp-setup) for prerequisites, troubleshooting, and step-by-step instructions.

---

### MCP Client Configuration

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials in all examples below.

#### Optional: Code Mode Transform (`DYNAMIC_TOOLS`)

`DYNAMIC_TOOLS` is optional and only affects startup behavior:

- Code Mode is enabled only when `DYNAMIC_TOOLS` is set to `true` (case-insensitive).
- Code Mode is disabled when `DYNAMIC_TOOLS` is not set or set to any other value.
- Variable name is strict: use `DYNAMIC_TOOLS` (plural). `DYNAMIC_TOOL` is ignored.

When enabled, the server starts with `CodeMode()` and exposes Code Mode meta-tools to the client. When disabled, the server runs without the transform and exposes the normal registered tool catalog directly. Recommended to use `CodeMode()` when you have multiple MCP servers running to preserve your context window.

#### Optional: Configuration Write-Back (`ENABLE_CONFIG_WRITES`)

`central_get_config` (read-only) is always available and lets the assistant pull Central configuration profiles (VLANs, SSIDs, scope maps, and any other `network-config/v1alpha1` resource) into the conversation.

`central_write_config` writes configuration back to Central and is **off by default**. To enable it, add `ENABLE_CONFIG_WRITES=true` to the server's environment (the `env` block of your MCP client config, or `.env`). When enabled:

- Every create, update, replace, or delete shows the current configuration and the exact request body in a confirmation prompt; nothing is sent to Central until you accept. Your MCP client must support elicitation.
- The API client needs write permission for Central configuration.
- Changes apply to live configuration and may re-provision devices. Test in a lab first.

#### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "central-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--prerelease=allow", "central-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CENTRAL_BASE_URL": "your-central-base-url",
        "CENTRAL_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "CENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See the [Claude Desktop setup guide](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/central-mcp-claude-desktop-setup) for full steps and troubleshooting.

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add central-mcp \
  -e CENTRAL_BASE_URL=your-central-base-url \
  -e CENTRAL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id \
  -e CENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret \
  -- uvx --prerelease=allow central-mcp-server
```

See the [Claude Code setup guide](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/central-mcp-claude-code-setup) for full steps and troubleshooting.

#### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

Add `.vscode/mcp.json` to your workspace root and add that path to `.gitignore` to keep credentials out of version control:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "central-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--prerelease=allow", "central-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CENTRAL_BASE_URL": "your-central-base-url",
        "CENTRAL_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "CENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add to `.gitignore`:
```
.vscode/mcp.json
```

See the [GitHub CoPilot setup guide](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/central-github-copilot-setup) for full steps and troubleshooting.

#### HTTP Transport (Streamable HTTP)

By default the server runs over `stdio`, which is the right choice for most MCP clients. If you need to run the server as a persistent HTTP process — for example, to share it across multiple clients or to connect via a remote URL — you can switch to the `streamable-http` transport.

**Step 1 — Install the server as a CLI tool** (if you haven't already):

```bash
uv tool install --prerelease=allow central-mcp-server
```

> `--prerelease=allow` is required because this server depends on `pycentral`, which currently only has a pre-release version on PyPI.

**Step 2 — Create a `.env` file** in your working directory with your credentials and transport settings:

```
CENTRAL_BASE_URL=your-central-base-url
CENTRAL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
CENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
MCP_TRANSPORT=http
MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1
MCP_PORT=8000
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | Transport mode: `stdio` or `http` |
| `MCP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host to bind when using HTTP transport |
| `MCP_PORT` | `8000` | Port to listen on when using HTTP transport |

**Step 3 — Start the server:**

```bash
# If installed via uv tool install:
central-mcp-server

# If running from source:
python server.py
```

The MCP endpoint will be available at `http://<MCP_HOST>:<MCP_PORT>/mcp`.

**Step 4 — Connect your MCP client** to the running server:

```bash
claude mcp add central-mcp --transport http --url http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

Or add it to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "central-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Credentials must be set in the server's environment (via `.env` or OS env vars) before starting it. They are not passed through the HTTP client config.

## What You Can Ask

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant questions like:

- *"Give me a health overview of all sites."*
- *"Which sites are in poor health right now?"*
- *"Show me all access points at the Chicago office."*
- *"List the switches in the London campus and show CPU and PoE trends for SG34L5002Y."*
- *"How healthy is the BLR gateway cluster, and what's its client capacity trend?"*
- *"What critical alerts are active across the network?"*
- *"Find all failed wireless clients at HQ in the last 24 hours."*
- *"What events happened on switch SW-CORE-01 yesterday?"*
- *"Ping 8.8.8.8 from switch SW-CORE-01."*
- *"Run 'show version' and 'show interfaces brief' on switch SG43KN5017."*
- *"Bounce PoE on port 1/1/6 of switch SG43KN5017."*
- *"Show me the VLAN profiles configured in Central."*
- *"Change the description on VLAN 10 to 'Staff'."* (requires `ENABLE_CONFIG_WRITES=true`)

See [Central MCP Server in Action]((https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/central-mcp-in-action)) for real query examples across all supported clients.

## Example Queries

New to driving an AI assistant over your network? See **[What You Can Ask](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/central-mcp-example-queries)** — a guided tour of real questions across every tool category (site health, devices, APs, switches, gateways, WLANs, clients, alerts, events, and live diagnostics), each shown with the answer it returns and a list of related questions to try.

### Tools

The 0.2.x surface folds related operations into 14 tools (13 plus `central_write_config` when `ENABLE_CONFIG_WRITES=true`). Envelope-returning reads default to `response_format="concise"`; use `"detailed"` for full item fields.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `central_get_devices` | Browse inventory or family monitoring data; exact serial/name lookup is supported. |
| `central_get_device_details` | Retrieve AP, switch, or gateway detail with family-specific includes. |
| `central_get_device_trends` | Retrieve bounded AP, switch, or gateway time-series samples. |
| `central_get_clients` | Browse filtered clients or look up one exact MAC address. |
| `central_get_client_analytics` | Client usage, roam trail, or per-stage onboarding analytics (`metric` selects the family). |
| `central_get_sites` | Retrieve summary or detailed site health views. |
| `central_get_wlans` | List WLANs or add throughput to one exact SSID. |
| `central_get_gateway_cluster` | Retrieve cluster members, health, and optional capacity/resources. |
| `central_get_events` | Retrieve event records (`mode="records"`) or facets (`mode="facets"`). |
| `central_get_alerts` | Retrieve filtered active, cleared, or deferred alerts for a site. |
| `central_run_network_test` | Run a live network diagnostic against a device. |
| `central_run_show_commands` | Run validated show commands and return their output. |
| `central_bounce_port` | Bounce ports or toggle PoE after explicit confirmation. |
| `central_get_config` | Read configuration profiles, shared or scope-level. |
| `central_write_config` | Write configuration back after explicit confirmation (opt-in: `ENABLE_CONFIG_WRITES=true`). |

### LLM Workflow for Events

1. Resolve the target `site_id`.
2. Call `central_get_events` with `mode="facets"` and `response_mode="compact"` to discover useful filters.
3. Call it again with `mode="records"` and targeted `category`, `source_type`, or `event_id` filters.
4. Use `mode="facets"`, `response_mode="full"` only when exact per-value counts are required.

### Guided Prompts

The server includes 12 built-in prompts to help AI assistants run common workflows:

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `network_health_overview` | Full network health overview across all sites |
| `troubleshoot_site` | Deep-dive troubleshooting for a specific site |
| `client_connectivity_check` | Investigate connectivity status for a client by MAC address |
| `investigate_device_events` | Review recent events for a specific device |
| `site_event_summary` | Summarize all events at a site within a time window |
| `failed_clients_investigation` | Find and diagnose all failed clients at a site |
| `site_client_overview` | Overview of client connectivity at a site |
| `device_type_health` | Health check for all devices of a specific type at a site |
| `top_event_drivers` | Identify dominant event drivers at a site and pull supporting evidence |
| `critical_alerts_review` | Review all active critical alerts across the network |
| `wlan_health_check` | Assess WLAN health using client failures and related events over a time window |
| `compare_site_health` | Compare health metrics side-by-side across multiple sites |
